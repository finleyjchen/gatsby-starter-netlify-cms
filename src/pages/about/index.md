Hi there! My name is Finley Chen. I am a web developer who works with businesses to create an outstanding online web presence.

### That’s me on the left. 2001

### 

I made my first website at 11 years old – it was a WordPress website for my video game clan. Since then, I’ve been using my knowledge in mySQL, PHP, and of course HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help other businesses harness the potential of WordPress. I am from San Diego but now live in San Luis Obispo, California for school at Cal Poly.

### 

### Why I’m good at what I do

There’s no question the developer world is a fast-paced, growing one. There are new frameworks, trends, and technologies that developers have to constantly be learning and getting familiar with.

### 

I am great at reaching solutions to problems because of my ability to learn new things fast – Google, Stack Overflow, and software documentation are some of the resources I’m constantly using and reading every day.



In preparation for the upcoming release of Gutenberg, I have been learning React and Redux.
